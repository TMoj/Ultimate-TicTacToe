# Ultimate-TicTacToe
This is just a minor Project done to familiarize myself with programming a bit more.
Nothing too special, really.

As to how this is supposed to play out I shall copy the rules into this and say this beforehand:
IT WAS DESINGED FOR A FULLSCREEN WINDOW ON A DESKTOP.

Copy of the rules(translated mind you):

basic rules:
	-you can only click into the left field
	-players take turns
	-a win on the left side is translated to the right side
	-to win on the right side is to win the game
	-whoever softlocks the game loses
more detailed rules:
	-you can start wherever on the left side
	-every turn after the first one is only possible in the white field on the left
	-clicking on a field changes the smaller field as well (example, you press top left in the central field, you switch to top left field)
	-after winning a small field, it is still useable
	-Lady RNG chooses the starting player
	-she also decides if you tie a smaller field on the left
notes:
	-you can use a large amount of tactics
	-there is NO A.I., so grab a fellow human to play
	-the softlock can only occur in the field with the green border
